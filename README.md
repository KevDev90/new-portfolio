## About Me

I was first introduced to code when I was 14 years old during my Myspace days with Tom. Little did I know that using that platform would strike a curiosity in me to pursue coding later on in my life.

I have an athletic background having played some baseball in college, and I like to bring that same intensity to the code editor! After my athletic career, I worked various odd jobs in Colorado. I then met and married my wife Zhibek who motivated me to start thinking more long term about my career.

I thought back on how much I enjoyed messing around with HTML, and decided to give it a go! Flash forward to 2020-2021, I started and completed Thinkful's software engineering program! This Bootcamp gave me the mentorship and direction I needed to stay on track while challenging myself in ways I didn't think were previously possible!

Some of my other hobbies include hiking, reading, snowboarding, going to concerts, and playing board games with my wife. While I have thoroughly enjoyed building out multiple projects on my own, I can't wait to work on a team with other awesomely talented programmers!
